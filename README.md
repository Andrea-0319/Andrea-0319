# Hi there 👋, I'm Andrea Scalora.

🎓 *Bachelor’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pavia.*

Passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems. Skilled in Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Eager to contribute to innovative AI projects, with a strong interest in predictive analytics and Large Language Models. Motivated to grow professionally in a dynamic and forward-thinking environment.

# Projects 💻

📚 Here are some of my academic projects:

### [WatorPlus](https://github.com/Andrea-0319/WatorPlus) | Computer Programming course

- **🧠 Overview**: An extended Wa‑Tor predator–prey simulation featuring sharks, fish, drifting jellyfish (toxic hazards) and regrowing kelp on a continuous toroidal grid. 
- **🛠️ Technologies**: Python, NumPy for numerical modeling, Matplotlib for real‑time visualization, CustomTkinter/Tkinter for a lightweight GUI, VS Code.
- **📊 Results**: Emergent population dynamics, demonstration of rule‑based agent interactions in a shared environment, and an interactive interface for experimenting with ecosystem parameters.

### [Customer Segmentation and Predictive Model](https://github.com/Andrea-0319/Customer_Segmentation) | Machine Learning course

- **🧠 Overview**: Developed a clustering framework to segment ~2,200 customers based on demographics and spending behavior + a predictive Model for the "Response" feature using different algorithms.
- **🛠️ Technologies**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, K-Means, PCA, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Voting Ensemble, Bagging, seaborn/matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks (Deepnote).
- **📊 Results**: Identified four actionable customer segments (“Stars,” “High Potential,” “Need Attention,” “Leaky Bucket”) with clear profiles to inform targeted marketing.

### [Personalized Search Engine](https://github.com/Andrea-0319/Personalized_Search_Engine) | Information retrieval and Recommender systems course

- **🧠 Overview**: This work implements a personalized information retrieval system over a community Question-Answering collection (SE-PQA), aiming to return contextually relevant answers to users’ queries by blending lexical, semantic and user-specific signals. 
- **🛠️ Technologies**: Python, Pyterrier, BM25, HuggingFace Transformers (MiniLM, DistilBERT-QA, T5-small), Fusion strategies (RRF and Weighted linear sum), custom Python modules for text preprocessing, data I/O, parameter grid search and evaluation with rangx, Jupyter notebooks (Deepnote).
- **📊 Results**: This project demonstrates that while traditional retrieval methods such as BM25 provide a strong baseline, there is potential for improvement by integrating additional signals.
  
### [Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Andrea-0319/Churn_prediction) | AI for Communication and Marketing course

- **🧠 Overview**: Developed a predictive model to identify at-risk customers for an e-commerce platform, supporting targeted retention strategies.
- **🛠️ Technologies**: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SHAP, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter notebook (Vs Code).
- **📊 Results**: Provided actionable business insights and practical recommendations to improve customer retention and maximize Customer Lifetime Value.
 
### [Multi-Output Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/Andrea-0319/Multi-Output_Deep_Neural_Network) | Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks course

- **🧠 Overview**: Developed a deep learning solution to simultaneously predict both the sentiment (good/bad) and the numerical score of hotel reviews, using a combination of structured features and free-text data.
- **🛠️ Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM, MLP, multi-output models), Scikit-learn, Jupyter notebook (Google Colab).
- **📊 Results**: The final model achieved high accuracy in classifying review sentiment and low mean squared error for score prediction, demonstrated good generalization on unseen data, and was delivered as a reproducible, well-documented Colab notebook suitable for academic evaluation.
